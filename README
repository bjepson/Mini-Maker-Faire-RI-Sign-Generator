You'll need a Google Docs spreadsheet containing your makers for this to work.

key.php needs to define a variable called $spreadsheet_key that refers to the Google Docs spreadsheet containing your data.

You'll also need http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.en.html installed since it uses the qrencode binary to generate QR Codes.

If you want to use this, you probably need more stuff from Brian Jepson's collection of scripts that make the RI Mini Maker Faire tick.
